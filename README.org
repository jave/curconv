* Emacs currency conversion
Now and then I need to convert between different currencies.

curconv.el provides some Emacs functions to do this.

This initial implementation is fairly simple and works like this.

- Get an API key from https://openexchangerates.org/
- (setq curconv-api-key "my-api-key")
- (curconv-cache-rates), whenever you want to refresh the rates cache
- (curconv 5 'SEK 'BTC), converts 5 Swedis Krona to Bitcoin


It is meant to be possible to use different providers, but I have only
implemented openexchangerates. This provider has a nice API but is
inconvenient in that you need to register in order to get an API key.

Suggestions for more convenient providers are welcome.
